# Information

The Biblical Online Synopsis (BOS) aims to establish an open-access online synopsis of the Hebrew Bible, providing global access to various textual traditions (the Masoretic Text, the so-called biblical manuscripts from the Dead Sea, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Septuagint and its daughter translations, quotations of biblical texts in Patristic and Rabbinic literature etc.), especially for scholarly purposes but also for non-specialists. Users have an easy and unprecedented possibility to compare textual variants in each verse, and they will be provided with a number of additional features which illuminate textual variants and their importance. High priority is given to well-ordered-information, ease of use, visuals, and accessibility. Collaboration will also be key, as some of the witnesses will be accessed from the web sites of other projects
